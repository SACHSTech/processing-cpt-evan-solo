# Sonic's parkour

The objective of the game is to reach Quandale Dingle, who is trapped on a remote island and attack him. Sonic must jump and navigate over the mountains and slay his mortal enemy. Use A and D to move left and right, while using spacebar to jump. Do not fall off a mountain, because you will lose a life. Using the F key or clicking the mouse will cause sonic to attack, and if you make it to Quandale's mountain and attack him, he loses a life. Attack Quandale twice before falling off the mountains 3 times and you win. Sonic has 3 lives and quandale has 2 lives.
